# Computer Shopping Tips

## General Tips

Set a budget (yes, computers are expensive, often hundreds of dollars, I wish they were not). Shop from that budget, maybe allowing yourself to go up or down by $50. Then look for the lightest-weight laptops in that price range, and narrow it down by the technical features (detailed below).

## Computer Components

While computers are inherently technical, shopping for computers feels 10x more technical. Shopping for a computer is a learning experience. You want a computer that will last, but not one you'll have to pay too much for. So here's my computer components buying guide:

-   **CPU**, the primary part that determines the computer's overall speed
    -   Choose Intel or AMD which are both great. Avoid MediaTek, Qualcomm, or ARM processors
    -   For Intel, avoid the old Pentium and Celeron, go with i3, i5, i7 (respectively: slow, medium, fast; also: cheap, medium, expensive). Model numbers start with the generation, and the current generation is 14 - e.g. `i3-14100F`. Anything down to 10th gen is still a good choice.
    -   For AMD CPUs, go with the Ryzen 3, 5, and 7 lineup. AMD CPUs have 4-digit numbers (then usually some letters), and the first number denotes the generation. You don't want to go older than the 5000 series (5th generation), e.g. `5300U`.
-   **RAM (Memory)**, determines how many things the computer can do at the same time
    -   8 <abbr title="Gigabyte, 1 billion bytes">GB</abbr> is the bare minimum, but hasn't been a good amount for a few years.
    -   16 GB is good, the normal amount for 2024.
    -   Higher than 16 GB is fairly rare and usually pretty extreme.
-   **Storage**, larger sizes hold more programs (typically small) and games (typically large), as well as photos and videos
    -   On a laptop, the **speed matters far more than the size of the disk**. Traditional spinning hard drives (HDDs) are extremely slow in comparison to much faster solid state drives (SSDs), however a SSD won't hold nearly as much data as a HDD. The speed boost is _far worth the trade_ - choose SSD over HDD! It's the difference between the computer starting in 5 seconds vs 5 minutes.
    -   256 GB SSD is the minimum amount that will work.
    -   I recommend a 512 GB SSD (1/2 <abbr title="Terabyte, 1 trillion bytes">TB</abbr>).
    -   It's rare to see a laptop SSD over 1 TB (very large), so watch out that you don't accidentally buy a HDD.
-   **GPU (video card)**, determines how well the computer can render pixels in a game
    -   This isn't significant for our class, so any built-in GPU that comes with the CPU ("Intel HD" series or "AMD Raden E" series) is good enough.
    -   GPUs are a significant cost center for PCs, but if you want the computer to play games, get a Nvidia RTX or Radeon RX series GPU.
-   **Accessories**, Mouse, Keyboard, Monitor
    -   Laptops have all of these built-in, so they aren't required for the class.
    -   A wireless mouse can often help get things done faster, and you can bring it to class if you want.
-   **Manufacturer**, what computers are good?
    -   Most PC manufacturers are good, given they use genuine parts from known parts manufacturers (Intel, etc.).
    -   The top manufacturers are Lenovo, HP, Dell, Asus, and Acer. Of those, HP and Dell are American.
    -   A few others I recommend are Microsoft (surface laptops) and Framework (DIY).
