# The Strutzes

_It's pronounced "struts" like a car part. When plural, because it ends in `z`, it's "struts'es"_

Nathan & Alanda have been married for over <how-many-years-ago :since="2001" /> years, and have homeschooled their 4 children since birth. This year is their <how-many-years-ago :since="2008" :ordinal="true" /> consecutive year teaching their own children.

Nathan and Alanda are deacons at Grace Christian Fellowship in Ladson. They had a 20 year run teaching bible lessons to middle school students (some say they still haven't quit). You'll often find them volunteering in the nursery, teaching a bible study, or bringing a dish to a friend in need.

## Nathan

_Mr. Strutz, or Mr. Nathan_

<img src="/images/nathan.jpg" alt="Nathan" class="profile-photo"> Nathan was born at a young age, and quickly thereafter found Jesus and computers, and has spent a lifetime connected to both. Nathan has worked in the computing field for over 25 years. Most recently, <how-many-years-ago :since="2007" /> years at Boeing, which moved the Strutz family to the lowcountry just <how-many-years-ago :since="2014" /> short years ago. Nathan started teaching _Intro to Coding_ at SHEEP in 2020, which branched into the _Computing Fundamentals_ class in 2024.

## Alanda

_It's pronounced like "Amanda" but with an "L"_

Alanda has spent her professional life in real estate, insurance, and missions, but started teaching at SHEEP in 2018 when she became empassioned about teaching young people the most important lessons at the most critical point of their life - how to succeed at life before adulthood. It's a labor of love, and she loves deeply. She also teaches the public speaking class, in addition to _Computing Fundamentals_.

In 2016, Alanda started a nonprofit missions organization, [Precious Ones Ministries](https://www.preciousonesministries.org/), which provides hope to people in need through education, nutrition, and bibles!
