# Student Computers

Students are required to bring a fully working computer to class every week. It needs to have battery capacity to last the entire class hour, or else bring a power adapter and possibly an extension cord. The lessons are about computers, done while using the computer, so students will need a computer. SHEEP will not provide this for you.

:::warning
Every year, someone will

- Forget their computer at home
- Drop their computer
- Lose their charger
- Come to class without enough battery
- Not have permission to install software

**Don't let it be you!** Please take care of these things before you come to class.

#### Practical Concerns: weight, space, dropping, thieves

Some common issues with bringing a laptop to school are the size and weight in a backpack, and fear of it getting damaged, stolen, or lost. While we cannot guarantee you will be free from problems, we can recommend some solutions to plan ahead:

1. Leave it in your car. Often parents may camp out in the parking lot or come-and-go as their children have classes in different periods. If it is convenient, leave your computer in the vehicle. I recommend storing it in the trunk or where it is not visible. This saves space in backpacks, and reduces the risk of it getting dropped, lost, or stolen throughout the day.

2. Buy a smaller, especially thinner, lightweight device that your student can carry more easily. While there is a higher price for sub-notebook computers, there is a lower price for a smaller screen. Look for a good compromise [when you go shopping](computer-shopping).

   - Most laptops weight 4 to 6 pounds, but range from 2 to 8
   - A 17" screen is extremely large and requires an oversized backpack or case; 15" is average, 12" is often too small

3. Add paint or stickers to make sure your computer is easily distinguishable from others. This makes it harder for someone to walk off with it, by accident or on purpose.

## What Computers Will Work?

Our class exclusively uses Windows-based notebook PCs and Chromebooks. Yes, I'm sorry, but no Apple products, no tablets, and phones aren't a capable substitute.

**All laptops need at least 8 GB of RAM**.

### Windows

Windows-based computers are the most common computers in the world, and knowing how to use them is critical to working most jobs. I highly recommend sending your student to school with one of these.

Windows 11 is the current version. If your laptop does not have this, it's probably too old. If it originally shipped with windows 7, 8 or Vista, it's definitely too old.

Please check your computer for **Windows "S Mode" that won't allow us to install programs** or do the things we need in our class.

Please **check for Windows Updates** and install all the updates your Windows-based PC can handle. We need you to do this at home so that Windows doesn't try to install them during class. Time in our class is precious - we get 1 hour per week maximum, so we need to optimize it as much as possible.

:::tip Permissions Check
Please check to make sure that your student has the necessary permissions in Windows to install programs when we need to. Check the User Account Controls. If your student has a child account or limited account, please remove these restrictions.

### Chromebooks

Chrome OS is wildly popular in schools because of its lower price. Chromebooks require less computing power, so the devices tend to be far less capable, which is a danger when we need to do heavy lifting.

:::warning Warning - Not All Chromebooks Will Work!
Many Chromebooks do not have the computing power necessary to install Linux. This is especially true for older Chromebooks and those running MediaTek or Qualcomm (smartphone) CPUs.
:::

The best way to know your Chromebook is powerful enough is to buy one with an Intel or AMD CPU. Intel should be 10th generation or newer, something like the i3, i5, or i7 lineup, and avoid Pentium and Celeron. AMD should be 5th generation or later Ryzen CPUs, avoid Athlon.

To simplify all of this math, you can shop for a "Chromebook Plus," which is a new designation from Google that means it has enough computing power for our class.

## What Software Will Be Needed?

Please make sure your child's computer has the latest operating system updates. We don't want to sit around while Windows Update finishes on your computer.

In Windows, use the start menu to search for Windows Update, or open the Settings and click on Update & Security.

On Chrome OS, connect to WiFi and open the settings. Scroll down to About Chrome OS, and check for updates there.

Please make sure they have a web browser that you like, such as Firefox or Chrome.

Throughout the year, we will install programs on this computer. You may get a glimpse of them in the [syllabus](syllabus). Please make sure your student has all the necessary permissions on the laptop to install programs.

## What Online Accounts Will Be Made?

As you know, online tools always require accounts. This is critical to using applications such as Google Docs. We will do our best to form good password practices, and we will request permission from a parent or legal guardian for each service that we need.
