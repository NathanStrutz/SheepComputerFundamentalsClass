# Students Computers

Students are required to bring a fully working computer to class every week. It needs to ahve battery capacity to last the entire hour, or also bring a power adapter and possibly an extension cord. The lessons are about computers, done while using the computer, so students will need a computer. SHEEP will not provide this for you.

#### Practical Concerns: weight, space, dropping, thieves

Some common issues with bringing a laptop to school are the size and weight in a backpack, and fear of it getting damaged, stolen, or lost. While we cannot guarantee you will be free from problems, we can recommend some solutions ahead-of-time:

1. Leave it in your car. Often parents may camp out in the parking lot or come-and-go as their children have classes in different periods. If it is convenient, leave your computer in the vehicle. I recommend storing it in the trunk or whever it is not visible.

2. Buy a smaller, especially thinner, lightweight device. While there is a higher price for sub-notebook computers, there is a lower price for a smaller screen. Look for a good compromise when you go shopping.

    - Most laptops weight 4 to 6 pounds, but range from 2 to 8
    - A 17" screen is extremely large and requires an oversized backpack or case, 15" is average, 12" is often too small

3. Add paint or stickers to make sure your computer is easily distinguishable from others.

# What Computers Will Work?

Our class exclusively used Windows-baced PCs. No Macs. No Chromebooks.

:::tip TODO
re-think this. Shouldn't we allow chromebooks? I don't think macs are a good idea.

## Shopping Tips

### General Tips

Set a budget (yes, computers are expensive, often hundreds of dollars, I wish it weren't true). Shop from that budget, maybe allowing yourself to go up or down by $50. Then look for the lightest-weight laptops in that price range, and narrow it down by features.

### Tax Free Weekend

South Carolina's Tax-Free Weekend is August 2 - 4, 2024. Make sure to take avantage of this benefit!

### Computer Components

While computers are inherently technical, shopping for computers feels 10x more. Shopping for a compuer is a learning experience. You want a computer that will last, but not one you'll have to pay too much for. So here's my computer components buying guide:

-   **CPU**, the primary part that determines the computer's overall speed; choose Intel or AMD, they are both really good
    -   For Intel, avoid the old Pentium and Celeron, go with i3, i5, i7. Model numbers start with the generation, and the current generation is 14. Anything down to 10th gen is still a good choice.
    -   For AMD CPUs, go with the Ryzen 3, 5, and 7 lineup. AMD CPUs have 4-digit numbers (then usually some letters), and the first number denotes the generation. You don't want to go older than the 5000 series (5th generation).
-   **RAM (Memory)**, determines how many things the computer can do at the same time
    -   8 <abbr title="Gigabyte, 1 billion bytes">GB</abbr> is the bare minimum, but hasn't been a good amount for a few years.
    -   16 GB is good, probably the norm for today.
    -   Higher than 16 GB is fairly rare and usually pretty extreme.
-   **Storage**, larger sizes hold more programs (typically small) and games (typically large), as well as photos and videos
    -   On a laptop, the **speed matters far more than the size of the disk**. Traditional spinning hard drives (HDDs) are extremely slow in comparison to much faster solid state drives (SSDs), however a SSD won't hold nearly as much data as a HDD. The speed boost is _far worth the trade_ - choose SSD over HDD! It's the difference between the computer starting in 5 seconds vs 5 minutes.
    -   256 GB SSD is the minimum amount that will work.
    -   I recommend a 512 GB SSD (1/2 <abbr title="Terabyte, 1 trillion bytes">TB</abbr>).
    -   It's rare to see a laptop SSD over 1 TB (very large), so watch out that you don't buy a HDD.
-   **GPU (video card)**, determines how well the computer can render pixels in a game
    -   This isn't significant for our class, so any built-in GPU ("Intel HD" series or "AMD Raden E" series) are good enough.
    -   GPUs are a significant cost center for PCs, but if you want the computer to play games, get a Nvidia RTX or Radeon RX series GPU.
-   **Mouse, Keyboard, Monitor** Accessories
    -   Laptops have these built-in, so they aren't required for the class. Feel free to plug into them at home.
    -   A wireless mouse can often help get things done faster. I recommend Logitech products.
-   **Manufacturer**, what computer builders are good?
    -   Most PC manufacturers are good, given they use genuine parts from known parts manufacturers (Intel, etc.).
    -   The top manufacturers are Lenovo, HP, Dell, Asus, and Acer. Of those, HP and Dell are American.
    -   A few others I recommend are Microsoft (surface laptops) and Framework (DIY).
