# Student Computers

Students are required to bring a fully working computer to class every week. It needs to have battery capacity to last the entire class hour, or else bring a power adapter and possibly an extension cord. The lessons are about computers, done while using the computer, so students will need a computer. SHEEP will not provide this for you.

#### Practical Concerns: weight, space, dropping, thieves

Some common issues with bringing a laptop to school are the size and weight in a backpack, and fear of it getting damaged, stolen, or lost. While we cannot guarantee you will be free from problems, we can recommend some solutions to plan ahead:

1. Leave it in your car. Often parents may camp out in the parking lot or come-and-go as their children have classes in different periods. If it is convenient, leave your computer in the vehicle. I recommend storing it in the trunk or where it is not visible. This saves space in backpacks, and reduces the risk of it getting dropped, lost, or stolen throughout the day.

2. Buy a smaller, especially thinner, lightweight device. While there is a higher price for sub-notebook computers, there is a lower price for a smaller screen. Look for a good compromise [when you go shopping](computer-shopping).

    - Most laptops weight 4 to 6 pounds, but range from 2 to 8
    - A 17" screen is extremely large and requires an oversized backpack or case, 15" is average, 12" is often too small

3. Add paint or stickers to make sure your computer is easily distinguishable from others. This makes it harder for someone to walk off with it.

# What Computers Will Work?

Our class exclusively used Windows-baced PCs. No Macs. No Chromebooks.

:::warning TODO
re-think this. Shouldn't we allow chromebooks? I don't think macs are a good idea.

# What Software Will Be Needed?

Please make sure your child's computer has this:

-   Microsoft Windows 10 or 11
-   Web Browser like Firefox or Chrome
